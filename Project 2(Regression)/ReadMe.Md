### In this task, I used a regression algorithm on the California dataset from SKlearn and I applied two models to solving this task

* Ridge Model
* RandomForestRegressor

#### Both models try to predict the target variable which is the Median house value.

#### RandomForestRegressor scored higher than the Ridge model for this particular task.
